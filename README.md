# Disaster-Response-Coordination-Platform

## Project Status

- **Backend**: Fully scaffolded (Node.js/Express), connected to Supabase, all models, services, controllers, and routes implemented.
- **Frontend**: Scaffolded with React (Vite), folder structure and placeholder components/pages created.
- **Database**: Supabase project set up, PostGIS enabled, all required tables and indexes created.

## Next Steps

1. **Backendâ€“Frontend Integration**
   - Connect frontend to backend APIs (using axios and socket.io-client).
   - Implement API calls and real-time updates in frontend components.

2. **Testing**
   - Test backend endpoints (CRUD, real-time, etc.) using Postman or similar tools.
   - Test frontend forms and data flows.

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy backend (e.g., Render).
   - Deploy frontend (e.g., Vercel).
   - Set environment variables for production.

## Getting Started

- See `/backend` for backend code and setup.
- See `/frontend` for frontend code and setup (initialize with Vite or Create React App if not already done).
- See Supabase dashboard for database management.
